        <h3>Arecibo Observatory</h3>
        <p>
            Made famous by the Jodi Foster film Contact, The Arecibo Observatory 
            is a radio telescope in the municipality of Arecibo, Puerto Rico. It 
            gained noterity in 1999 when it began to collect data for the 
            SETI@home project - an academic project to analyze radio signals, 
            searching for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence.

            When we think about going into space we often think about exploring the 
            unknown. Space exploration has also given us the opportunity to back 
            towards ourselves.

        <h3>Meteor Crater</h3>
        <p>
            Meteor Crater is a crater located in norther Arizona. It is privately owned
            by the Barringer family through the Barringer Crater Comapny. This is one of 190
            confirmed craters on Earth.

        <p>
            The mountain is a large extinct volcano, in the form of a ring mountain with 
            a diameter of about 4 km. The Nama called the mountain Geitsi Gubib after the
            long, flowing loincloth worn by Khoikhoi women, known in Afrikaans as broek-en-karos, 
            Germanicized to Brukkaros.

        <h3>Han River Delta</h3>
        <p>
            Here we see the mouth of the Han River. Fertilizer and industrial runoff
            has created the striking green as the river flows into the Pacific. 
            <br>
            Eutrophication is excessive richness of nutrients in a lake or other body 
            of water, frequently due to runoff from the land, which causes a dense 
            growth of plant life and death of animal life from lack of oxygen.

        <h3>Elwha Dam</h3>
        <p>
            Elwha Dam was a dam located in the Pacific Northwest. Originally build 
            in 1910, removal of the dam completed in 2013 allowing the Elwha river
            to flow freely. While fish returned to the river within 1 year, it takes
            up to 20 years to return to levels before the dam was built. 
        </p>
        <P>
            Zooming in (with your middle mouse scroll) you can uncover older sattelite
            imagery that shows what the dam looked like. Try zooming in and out to compare.
        </P>
        <p>
            This project is a case study in effectiveness of dam removal in restoring 
            ecology on this scale. If successful, it could encourage restoration 
            through further dam removals.

            Below is a time lapse of the 2020 California wildfires. Captured by 
            GOES-west sattelite operated by the United States' National Oceanic 
            and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s which supports supports weather 
            forecasting, severe storm tracking, and meteorology research. NOAA is one 
            of the many government organizations that has been neglected in leadership
            and funding under the current administration.

            Meanwhile, with the future of the Earth feeling precarious, two of the wealthiest men 
            on Earth desperately tring to get off the planet begin colonizing space. With the 
            first commercial trips to space costing 10s of millions of dollars, one wonders who
            space colonization will ultimately be accessible to. 
        </P>
        <p>
            Colonization isn't the only path space exploration offers. By turning the satellites 
            towards the Earth, we can see there is so much more to know about it, and how we can be 
            better stewards of it.
